# CI showdown

CI/CD pipelines have become an integral development tool for automating tedious tasks--from tests, to repository maintenance, to releases.

There are a number of CI/CD tools on the market, but today we'll be covering 3:

- GitHub Actions
- Gitlab CI/CD
- Tekton

### Comparing GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and Tekton: Similarities, Differences, Pros, and Cons  

Continuous Integration (CI) tools play a critical role in modern software development by automating code integration, testing, and deployment processes. GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and Tekton are three popular CI tools that cater to various workflows. This article explores their similarities, differences, and the advantages and disadvantages of each.  

---

### **Similarities**  

1. **Automation of CI/CD Pipelines**  
   All three tools support creating, managing, and automating CI/CD pipelines for tasks like building, testing, and deploying code.  

2. **Integration with Source Code Management (SCM)**  
   - GitHub Actions integrates seamlessly with GitHub repositories.  
   - GitLab CI is a native feature of GitLab.  
   - Tekton, while independent of a specific SCM, integrates well with Git-based workflows.  

3. **Support for Containerized Workflows**  
   They all support containerized environments using Docker images, enabling scalable, consistent builds and deployments.  

4. **Extensibility**  
   These tools offer extensions or plugins:  
   - GitHub Actions has a vast marketplace.  
   - GitLab CI supports custom scripts and integrations.  
   - Tekton allows building custom reusable tasks.

### **Differences**  

| Feature                | GitHub Actions                   | GitLab CI                       | Tekton                             |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Hosting**            | GitHub-hosted and self-hosted runners | GitLab-hosted and self-managed runners | Fully self-hosted                  |
| **Ease of Use**        | Simple YAML-based workflow files | YAML files with tighter GitLab integration | Advanced configuration via Kubernetes CRDs |
| **Platform Dependency**| Tied to GitHub repositories      | Tied to GitLab repositories     | Repository-agnostic                |
| **Pricing**            | Free for public repos, limited free tier for private repos | Free tier available, with more features in paid plans | Open-source and free, but requires infrastructure |
| **Pipeline Orchestration** | Direct YAML configuration       | Built-in integration with GitLab | Kubernetes-native orchestration    |
| **Scalability**        | Limited to GitHub’s infrastructure for hosted runners | Scales within GitLab ecosystem   | Kubernetes’ inherent scalability   |

### **Pros and Cons**  

#### **GitHub Actions**  
**Pros**  
- Seamless GitHub integration for repository management.  
- Large marketplace with prebuilt actions.  
- User-friendly YAML configuration for workflows.  
- Hosted runners reduce setup effort.  

**Cons**  
- Tied to GitHub repositories, limiting flexibility.  
- Hosted runners may have resource limitations for large-scale projects.  
- Limited free tier for private repositories.  

#### **GitLab CI**  
**Pros**  
- Native to GitLab, providing streamlined integration with its SCM and DevOps features.  
- Flexible runner options (hosted and self-managed).  
- Advanced features like security scanning and monitoring in higher-tier plans.  

**Cons**  
- Free tier offers fewer compute minutes compared to GitHub Actions.  
- Requires GitLab as the SCM, reducing flexibility for teams using other platforms.  

#### **Tekton**  
**Pros**  
- Kubernetes-native, enabling scalable and cloud-native pipeline orchestration.  
- Repository-agnostic, supporting a wide variety of use cases.  
- Highly customizable and extensible.  

**Cons**  
- Steeper learning curve due to Kubernetes-focused setup.  
- Requires infrastructure management and Kubernetes expertise.  
- Limited community resources compared to GitHub Actions and GitLab CI.
