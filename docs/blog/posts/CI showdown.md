# CI showdown

Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines have become an integral development tool for automating tedious tasks--from tests, to repository maintenance, to releases.

There are a number of CI/CD tools on the market, but today we'll be covering 3:

- GitHub Actions
- Gitlab CI/CD
- Tekton

!!! note

    For the purposes of this article, unless otherwise specified, the terms "workflow" and "pipeline" will be used interchangeably. "CI/CD" is colloquially abbreviated to "CI".

## What is a CI pipeline?

For those of you new to CI pipelines it's important to understand what they are, the main components, and how/why they're triggered.

### Pipeline components

While each different CI has unique features & idiosyncrasies, most consist of the same main components.

#### Trigger

What starts the pipeline. This can be manually triggered by a user or automatically on a schedule, a webhook, a git commit, etc.

#### Jobs

Sometimes also called "tasks", these are individual operations that usually accomplish a single task. That could be running static analysis or unit tests, linting, building a project, interacting with another service, etc. A job usually runs in a single container.

#### Steps

Jobs can often be broken down into smaller steps. While each job can use a different container image, steps usually (not always) all run in the same container. Jobs frequently only use a single step, but breaking up into multiple steps can help clarify to the user what's happening. Steps also allow you to include different configurations/environment variables that may not be necessary for the whole job.

#### Container image

As mentioned [above](#jobs), each time a pipeline runs a job, it starts a container image in which to run the job--this is a critical aspect of CI pipelines. The flexibility of containers is what allows developers to accomplish a variety of tasks without the need for managing the litany of dependencies.

## Comparing the tools

Lets examine a few of the available CI tools:

| Tool | Hosted on | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) | All Github plans | <ul><li>Simple</li></ul> | <ul></ul> |
| [Gitlab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) | All Gitlab tiers | <ul><li>Simple</li></ul> | <ul>Requires a [runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/)</ul> |
| [Tekton](https://tekton.dev/) | Kubernetes | <ul><li>More configurable</li><li>By being hosted in Kubernetes, no server is required</li></ul> | <ul><li>Requires more configuration</li></ul> |

Now let's see what a simple pipeline would look like using each CI:

=== "Github Actions"

    ```yaml
    name: build-mkdocs
    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - main
    jobs:
      lint:
        container: markdownlint/markdownlint
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v4
          - name: Run Markdown lint
            run: mdl
      build_site:
        needs: [lint]
        container: squidfunk/mkdocs-material
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v4
          - name: Check for document
            run: |
              if [[ -f docs/myDoc.md ]]; then
                echo "myDoc.md exists!"
              fi
          - name: Build site
            run: mkdocs build
    ```

=== "Gitlab CI/CD"

    ```yaml
    workflow:
      name: build-mkdocs
      rules:
        - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == 'main'
    lint:
      image: markdownlint/markdownlint
      script: mdl
    build_site:
      needs: ["lint"]
      image: squidfunk/mkdocs-material
      run:
        - name: Check for document
          script: |
            if [[ -f docs/myDoc.md ]]; then
              echo "myDoc.md exists!"
            fi
        - name: Build site
          script: mkdoc build
    ```

=== "Tekton"

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
    kind: Pipeline
    metadata:
      name: build-mkdocs
    spec:

            kind: ClusterTask
          params:
            - name: url
              value: $(params.url)
          workspaces:
            - name: output
              workspace: repo
        - name: lint
          workspaces:
            - name: repo
              workspace: repo
          taskSpec:
            workspaces:
              - name: repo
            steps:
              - name: Run Markdown lint
                image: markdownlint/markdownlint
                workingDir: $(workspaces.repo.path)
                script: mdl
        - name: build_site
          workspaces:
            - name: repo
              workspace: repo
          taskSpec:
            workspaces:
              - name: repo
            stepTemplate:
              workingDir: $(workspaces.repo.path)
            steps:
              - name: Check for document
                script: |
                  if [[ -f docs/myDoc.md ]]; then
                    echo "myDoc.md exists!"
                  fi
              - name: Build site
                image: squidfunk/mkdocs-material
                script: mkdocs build
    ```

The pipeline accomplishes the following: 

```mermaid
stateDiagram
  direction LR
  A: Clone repository --> B: Run Markdown lint
  B --> build_site
  state build_site {
    direction LR
    C: Check that a file exists --> D: Build MkDocs
